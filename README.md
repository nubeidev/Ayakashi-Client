# Ayakashi-Client
HOW TO INSTALL
Read EVERYTHING!

* move the "libraries" folder to %appdata%/.minecraft (for windows users)

* put the "Ayakashi" folder in the %appdata%/.minecraft/versions folder

* set the client version to "new installation" in the launcher, then ayakashi, then press other options and set the Java 11 folder located in the ayakashi folder + "\bin\javaw.exe" as the java executable windows directory

* if minecraft launcher throws an injector error or something like that do the same procedure for client like TLauncher
